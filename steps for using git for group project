1. Create the Central Repository
One person (the "Lead") should perform these steps first:

Sign in to GitHub and click the + icon in the top right -> New repository.

Name your project and keep it Public (or Private if you want to keep it under wraps until submission).

Initialize it with a README.md and a .gitignore (choose the template for your language, like Python or Java). This prevents junk files from being uploaded.

Add Collaborators: Go to Settings > Collaborators > Add people. Search for your teammates' usernames and invite them. They must accept the email invite to push code.

2. Connect Your Local Code
Once the repo is created, the Lead (or whoever has the initial code) should run these commands in their terminal/command prompt inside the project folder:

Bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
git push -u origin main
3. The Team Workflow (The "Safe" Way)
To avoid overwriting each other's work (merge conflicts), your team should follow this cycle:

A. Clone the Repo
Teammates should run this once to get the project on their machines:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git

B. Use Branches
Never code directly on the main branch. Create a branch for your specific feature:
git checkout -b my-new-feature

C. Push and Merge
Once you've written your segment:

git add .

git commit -m "Finished the login logic"

git push origin my-new-feature

Go to GitHub and click "Compare & pull request." This lets your team review the code before it joins the main project.

Pro-Tips for College Projects
Commits are receipts: If a teammate claims they worked 10 hours but has zero commits, GitHub's contribution graph will tell the truth.

Pull before you Push: Always run git pull origin main before starting your work for the day to make sure you have the latest version of your teammates' code.

README: Use the README.md to list who is responsible for which segment. It looks great to professors!
